# House Rules
As the cluster is a shared piece of equipment, please adhere to the following rules.

 - Cancel jobs that are useless/not producing valuable results ASAP
 - Make space for others!
    - Occupying the entire cluster for an hour/over night is ok
    - Do not allocate the entire cluster for weeks
    - Offload large datasets in your home `~` when not needed 
    - If you have multi-node, long-running jobs, clear them with [pgj](mailto:pgj@cs.aau.dk) first.
    - Other people may have tighter deadlines than you
 - Keep an eye on your jobs (daily)
    - your script may have failed, leading to wasted cpu-time for others
 - Clean up after yourself in `/scratch`
